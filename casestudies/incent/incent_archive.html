<!-- WP/Wordpress? Wix? Bootstrap? - No Thanks!...
There are none of those tags here, because I believe the proof is in the pudding.

I wrote this site from scratch, with a basic knowledge HTML/CSS, a lot of trial and error, failure and time on W3 schools. 
Im not a front end developer, but I do believe in understanding basic web principles is key to being a good UI designer.

Also, the most important thing to UX design?

Empathy.

I share some and understand developer pain points- what can and can't be done easily.
If you have any questions about the construction of this site, I'd love to help out.

<h1>Optimising the Onboarding Funnel</h1><br>

<p>How awesome would it be to get rewarded whenever and wherever you spend in crypto?</p>

<p>That was the premise behind Incent's Insync technology.</p>

<p>A slow uptake in the tech, lead to an ambitious goal of increasing conversion though the onboarding journey.</p><br>

<h2>Challenges</h2><br>

<p>To increase conversion, the entire onboarding flow would need to be scrutinised- from its screen order, language, interactions and even presentation.</p>

<p>Fundamentally the onboarding had to build both worth and trust with users.</p>


</div>

<h2>Flow and Language</h2><br>


<div class="container flex no-wrap">

	<img class="screen" src="images/screens_old/3.0.1_ourdifference.png"></img>
</div>



<p>In the onboarding funnel there was little drop-off in the introductory pages.
The largest drop-off was 24% on a page called "Our Difference".</p>

<p>However, Hotjar recordings showed us the majority of users 'skimmed' through these text-heavy introductory pages rather than reading them, spending less than 3 seconds per page on average.</p>

<p>These screens were full of information the company wanted users to know, rather than what users needed to know.</p> 

<p>Additionally there was two unnecessary steps, that were not required for users to enably insync platform: First name and a referral code.
These screens were a missed opportunity to brief users of the benefits to enabling Insync as well as introduce them to the syncing process.</p>

</div>

<div class="break32"></div>


<p>The first step was removing the pages users skimmed over and replacing them with pages of concise information that would answer the fundamental questions participants had.</p>

<p>Rather than explain in one text heavy page, different points were divided up into 3 'how it works' pages, with each concise point accompanied by a visual screen and a different colour.</p>
<p>The 3x steps were</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sync Your Card</li>
	<li>Get Rewarded</li>
	<li>Start Saving</li>
</ol>


<p>These pages explained a process in a simple format, but most importantly they conveyed the benefits of Insync in a relatable way rather than spruking the business' values.</p>

<p>The addition of these three screens with visual stimulus, slowed users down increasing the average time per page from 3 seconds to 10.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as each of these pages were presented as a 3x part slide show with animation, many users would revisit screens they previously skimmed over to re-read the offering. This showed an increased engagement with the pages content.</p>

<h2>Bank Search</h2><br>

	<img class="screen" src="images/screens_old/3.1.3_insync_search_filter_error.png"></img>
</div>


<p>A staggering 78% of users who reached this screen dropped off.</p>

<p>Half would begin searching and give up, the rest would skip.
This showed a lack of understanding in Insync and the necessity of bank syncing.
We conducted a user testing lab to work out why the other half gave up, with a simple test script: sync your bank to be rewarded.</p>

<p>We found 70% gave up due to the perceived latency.
When this page loaded, the default behaviour was to focus the search field, bringing up a keyboard on mobile.</p>

<p>This keyboard obscured the available banks which a user could simply tap on and misguided the user.
When a user began typing (which all participants instinctively did), the search process took an excessively long time and the majority of participants gave up because they either didn't understand what was happening or thought something was broken.

</div>

<div class="break32"></div>


<p>By removing the auto-focus from the search field, we immediately course-corrected users and invited them to discover the page.
By making this one small change 90% of participants in our user lab looked for their bank in the list rather than instinctively typing to search. This effectively bypassed the latency as a user could simply tap on their bank and progress to the next step (entering in Bank credentials).</p>

<p>The 10% who did search still had issues. 
To counter this the following improvements were made: informative text was retained when the user searched, banks were cached to reduce search latency and cancelling search would instantly return user to list of popular banks.</p>

<p>By retaining the informative text- it meant the page no longer felt empty/broken and gave the user something to focus on while they waited for their bank to appear.
If a user cancelled the search, presenting the popular banks gave them a fast and feasible alternative rather than having to reload the page or commit to doing another search.
Also by caching the banks themselves, the bank search's performance was dramatically increased, so that there was no longer the perception that the page was 'broken'.</p>

<p>In the user lab, after making these changes 92% were able to successfully complete the test script.</p>

<h2>Trust & Perception</h2><br>

<div class="break32"></div>



<p>Initially bank syncing was branded to look like part of Incent. This created a user perception and trust issue.  While all bank credential information was encrypted and sent directly to the bank, at least 70% of participants who ran through the pilot in our user labs said they felt uneasy about entering their bank credentials into a third party system (Incent).</p>

<p>Initially, we tried to allay these fears with a page on security with multiple notes on how we kept the user safe. However, despite the best of intentions, this page was actually detrimental raising more concerns than putting them to rest. 
Hotjar, showed the average user paused on this screen for about 40 seconds, with 11% of of participants dropping off. 72% of users then dropped off on the following bank credential entry screen, almost immediately.</p>

<p>For users that did choose to enter their credentials, the issue was further exacerbated by a long syncing time frame the user would have to sit through, adding to the sense of uncertainty with 30% dropping off during the syncing screen.</p>

<div class="break8"></div>

<ul class="box50 nobullet">
	<li class="solutions">Remove tech jargon from Security page and make it concise</li>
	<li class="solutions">Use pop-up animation for the bank credentials entry screen</li>
</ul>

<ul class="box50 nobullet">
	<li class="solutions">Bank credential screen was themed to mirror Bank’s brand identity</li>
	<li class="solutions"> Bank syncing process transformed into a background task</li>
</ul>

<div class="container flex">
	<img class="screen" src="images/screens_new/3.1.1_insync_banksignin_filled.png"></img>
</div>

<div class="break32"></div>




<p>By altering the security page, the average time spent on this page dropped from 12 seconds down to 4 seconds. Furthermore, dropoff on this page decreased from 20% down to 11%.</p>

<p>By adding a pop-up style animation and creating pages that mimicked the Bank's own login page, it helped build the perception that this was a bank portal 'popping-up'. Dropoff decreased from 42% to 35%.</p> 

<p>Moving the syncing process into the background meant that users would not have to wait for Insync to complete before beginning to use the Incent platform. This reduced the perceived wait time from 5-10minutes (an exceptionally long time for a user to sit on one screen) down to just 1-2 minutes. This reduced drop-off from 72% on this loading screen down to 28%.</p>

<p>Furthermore, instead of the user completing the process frustrated and skipping the end tour, it was found that users spent longer on the end tour (while Insync continued to sync in the background).</p>

<h2>Result</h2><br>

<p>Conversion of our onboarding funnel was 5x higher! from 4.7% to 28% (measured through hotjar).

<p>92% of participants in our user lab were able to sync their bank without any assistance.</p>

<p>Insync remains just one way a user can be rewarded by the Incent Platform.</p>
