<!-- WP/Wordpress? Wix? Bootstrap? - No Thanks!...
There are none of those tags here, because I believe the proof is in the pudding.

I wrote this site from scratch, with a basic knowledge HTML/CSS, a lot of trial and error, failure and time on W3 schools. 
Im not a front end developer, but I do believe in understanding basic web principles is key to being a good UI designer.

Also, the most important thing to UX design?

Empathy.

I share some and understand developer pain points- what can and can't be done easily.
If you have any questions about the construction of this site, I'd love to help out.

<h1>Optimising the Onboarding Funnel</h1><br>

<p>How awesome would it be to get rewarded whenever and wherever you spend in crypto?</p>

<p>That was the premise behind Incent's Insync technology.</p>

<p>A slow uptake in the tech, lead to an ambitious goal of increasing conversion though the onboarding journey.</p><br>

<h2>Challenges</h2><br>

<p>To increase conversion, the entire onboarding flow would need to be scrutinised- from its screen order, language, interactions and even presentation.</p>

<p>Fundamentally the onboarding had to build both worth and trust with users.</p>

	<p>Hotjar showed users skimmed these text-heavy pages and unnecessary steps, some dropping off altogether. They were a wasted opportunity to brief users on the benefits and syncing process steps. These screens were full of information the business wanted users to know, when all the user needed to know was:</p>

	<p>"What in it for me?"</p>

<p>By replacing these pages with a simple relatable 'how it works' format - users engagement increased on each page. 


Not only did the average drop-off per page decrease by over 10% but the slide animation meant many users revisited screens to re-read the benefits.</p>

<p>The staggering drop-off showed a lack of understanding in Insync, with a third of participants stating they didn't understand why they should sync their bank. This was due to a lack of communication on the prior screens.</p>

<p>The remaining partipants gave up due to the perceived latency. When the page loaded, the search field was auto-focused, bringing up a keyboard which obscured the bank list.</p>
<p>As a result, users instinctively began typing, which would initiate an excessively long search process.
Participants gave up because they didn't understand what was happening and felt as though the system was 'broken'.

<p>By removing the auto-focus from the search field it immediately course-corrected users to instinctively tap on their bank and progress to the next step.
This bypassed the latency issue associated with search.</p>

<p>To improve search itself, banks were cached which drastically reduced load times. Informative text was retained during search to give users something to direct their attention to instead of an empty page.</p>

<p>In addition, the cancel search function was improved to return users to a list of popular banks without the need to reload the page.</p>

<h2>Trust & Perception</h2><br>

<p>Initially bank syncing was branded to look like part of Incent. This created a user perception and trust issue.  While all bank credential information was encrypted and sent directly to the bank, at least 70% of participants who ran through the pilot in our user labs said they felt uneasy about entering their bank credentials into a third party system (Incent).</p>

<p>Initially, we tried to allay these fears with a page on security with multiple notes on how we kept the user safe. However, despite the best of intentions, this page was actually detrimental raising more concerns than putting them to rest. 
Hotjar, showed the average user paused on this screen for about 40 seconds, with 11% of of participants dropping off. 72% of users then dropped off on the following bank credential entry screen, almost immediately.</p>

<p>For users that did choose to enter their credentials, the issue was further exacerbated by a long syncing time frame the user would have to sit through, adding to the sense of uncertainty with 30% dropping off during the syncing screen.</p>

<div class="break32"></div>




<p>By altering the security page, the average time spent on this page dropped from 12 seconds down to 4 seconds. Furthermore, dropoff on this page decreased from 20% down to 11%.</p>

<p>By adding a pop-up style animation and creating pages that mimicked the Bank's own login page, it helped build the perception that this was a bank portal 'popping-up'. Dropoff decreased from 42% to 35%.</p> 

<p>Moving the syncing process into the background meant that users would not have to wait for Insync to complete before beginning to use the Incent platform. This reduced the perceived wait time from 5-10minutes (an exceptionally long time for a user to sit on one screen) down to just 1-2 minutes. This reduced drop-off from 72% on this loading screen down to 28%.</p>

<p>Furthermore, instead of the user completing the process frustrated and skipping the end tour, it was found that users spent longer on the end tour (while Insync continued to sync in the background).</p>

<h2>Result</h2><br>

<p>Conversion of our onboarding funnel was 5x higher! from 4.7% to 28% (measured through hotjar).

<p>92% of participants in our user lab were able to sync their bank without any assistance.</p>

<p>Insync remains just one way a user can be rewarded by the Incent Platform.</p>
